# PyMouseMove

This is a fairly basic python program ive made in free time, purely because i wanted to make my workflow as keyboard driven as possible

You may use it how you please, i do not care, but also will not be held liable. 

You can install it one of three ways

# 1. Installing via releases
    Steps:
        1. Go to the releases section on github ( ctrl + f and type in releases )
        2. Click on the latest release
        3. Download the executable file pymousemove.exe
        4. Download any one of the json files ( these are configs ) ( you can download multiple and it will prompt you to switch between them )
        5. As long as the executable and the json files are in the same directory, then just run the executable, and enjoy 

# 2. Installing from git 
    This assumes you have python installed, if you dont, download it from https://www.python.org/
    Steps: 
        1. Click on the green code button at the top middle right area 
        2. Click Download zip 
        3. Extract the zip to a folder
        4. Open that folder in cmd / terminal / whatever
        5. type pip install -r requirements.txt ( and hit enter )
        6. type python .\mousemove.py 
            ( you can alternatively just type python mous and then hit tab )
        7. rejoice


# Download from dist folder
    Steps:
        1. Click dist folder
        2. download the json file
        3. download pymousemove.exe
        ( you can use other configs but i am sending ijkl as its the best option im aware of )
